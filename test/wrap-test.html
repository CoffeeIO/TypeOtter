<section title="Introduction">
<section title="The project">
In this project, we've been tasked with creating the back-end of a functional ray tracer. This will function as the basis for a ray tracer, only missing the front-end, where all the calculations regarding rendering will be handled by our code. The ray tracer should satisfy the API given by the product owner, regardless of any API changes made during the development process.

This will require us to implement these features: The different, mathematically defined shapes, the parsing of PLY formatted files, mathematical expressions defining complex renderable shapes, lighting, shadowing, reflections and the ability to apply textures and transformations to shapes.

</section>
<section title="Initial analysis of viability, and initial risk assessment">
<p title="Changes from product owner">
As stated previously, the product owners can at any time change the API to any degree. The risks included with these possible changes are completely on the product owner, but as a worst case, that we couldn't make the deadline or we wouldn't be able to implement all required features.
</p>
<p title="Domain knowledge">
As <e>Equation</e> for knowledge regarding ray tracing, all team members have little to no previous knowledge regarding the domain. Here the lectures from Jesper and Patrick become quite crucial, as to provide enough domain knowledge, so that we don't spend too much of the development process researching ray tracing.

<section title="Main activities pre-sprinting">
Before the project work started, it was important to establish some common knowledge, and practices to be used during the project.

ne of the most essential knowledge sharing activities, was a one-day course in using GitHub, where some of the more experienced GitHub users, introduced the basics of git as well as more complex interactions with git.
