<section title="Collaboration">
    For multiple people collaborating on the same document there is multiple free options. One is with version control like <a href="https://github.com" url>GitHub</a> where you can invite poeple to commit pieces of the document through pull requests or directly to the main branch. The other more dynamic approach is <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/" url>JSFiddle</a> with it's collaboration feature, where you can work on the same content at the same time. Or the in-between, have your main index file in JSFiddle and include the seperate sections from remote git repository so you keep the version control.
