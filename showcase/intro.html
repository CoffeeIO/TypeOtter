        MlTex is a javascript library for creating documents with great typesetting on the web. MlTex is created purely with html, css and javascript with the intent to run completely client-side while also allowing the flexibility to run server side with no local files.
    </p>
    <p>
        MlTex runs as a html file in your browser, mlTex then processes your content to render pages that easily be printed or saved as pdf through your browser. This also means there is no installation process, support for all operating systems offering a browser with print and no need to re-compile your document to update your references!

        <section title="Local">
            For people how wants to run mlTex without an internet connection, you can download the required code and setup a local server.
            <div class="gist" data-gist="9dc07f3cef06dcff40328bc481ea0f3e" data-gist-file="setupLocal.sh"></div>
            From here we can create an html (index.html) file and navigate to it at <em>localhost:8000</em> in your browser.
            <div class="gist" data-gist="9dc07f3cef06dcff40328bc481ea0f3e" data-gist-file="mltexLocal.html"></div>
